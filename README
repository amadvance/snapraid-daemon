SnapRAID-Daemon
===============

DEVELOPMENT STATUS: EARLY ALPHA. This documentation serves as a roadmap for
the project. While the core daemon is under active development, many features
are not yet ready for production use.

SnapRAID-Daemon is a specialized companion service designed to move SnapRAID
from a manual, command-line interface (CLI) workflow to an 'always-on'
background service.

Under the hood, the daemon uses the same SnapRAID CLI binary, providing the
same level of reliability.

The daemon automates critical maintenance tasks, including the scheduling of
sync and scrub operations. It further enhances array reliability by monitoring
SMART values and providing a robust notification engine for real-time health
updates. For energy efficiency, it manages automatic disk spindown during
periods of inactivity.

The daemon also provides a modern REST API interface. This API provides a
programmatic gateway to monitor array health and trigger maintenance tasks,
serving as a powerful foundation that can be used to build a WebUI or other
remote integrations.
