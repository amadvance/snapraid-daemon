SnapRAID-Daemon
===============

DEVELOPMENT STATUS: EARLY ALPHA. This documentation serves as a roadmap for
the project. While the core daemon is under active development, many features
are not yet ready for production use.

SnapRAID-Daemon is a specialized companion service for SnapRAID that provides
a background process to automate and monitor your parity array.
It handles the scheduling of sync and scrub operations, monitors SMART
values, manages automatic disk spindown during inactivity, and provides a
robust notification engine.

The entire system is managed through a modern REST API interface. This API
provides a programmatic gateway to monitor array health and trigger
maintenance tasks, serving as a powerful foundation that can be used to build
a WebUI or other remote integrations.

By moving SnapRAID from a "manual CLI" workflow to an "always-on" service, you
get real-time monitoring, automated scheduling, and simplified management
without sacrificing the lightweight philosophy of the core engine.
