SnapRAID Daemon INSTALL
=======================

To build and install SnapRAID-Daemon, download the source code from
http://www.snapraid.it and unpack it with the following commands:

    tar xf snapraidd-.tar.gz
    cd snapraidd-*

To configure and build SnapRAID-Daemon, run:

    ./configure
    make

If the tests complete with "Success", install the application and documentation
using:

    sudo make install

To start using SnapRAID-Daemon, modify the example configuration file
snapraidd.conf.example to suit your needs and copy it to /etc/snapraidd.conf.

For additional guidance, refer to the SnapRAID-Daemon manpage by typing:

    man snapraidd


SnapRAID Daemon INSTALL
=======================

To build and install SnapRAID-Daemon, download the source code from
http://www.snapraid.it and unpack it with the following commands:

    tar xf snapraidd-*.tar.gz
    cd snapraidd-*

To configure the build environment and compile the binary, run:

    ./configure
    make

If the compilation completes without errors, install the application,
documentation, and system service files using:

   sudo make install


Post-Installation Setup
-----------------------

After the installation completes, the build system will automatically detect
your init system (systemd or BSD-style) and provide instructions.

# Systemd (Modern Linux)

If systemd is detected, the service file is installed automatically. To
enable the daemon to start at boot and start it immediately, run:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable --now snapraidd

To monitor the service status and logs:

    systemctl status snapraidd

# BSD-style init (Slackware and Others)

If a BSD-style init system is detected, the service script is placed in
/etc/rc.d/rc.snapraidd. First, ensure the script is executable:

    sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.snapraidd

To start the daemon automatically at boot, append the following to your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.snapraidd ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.snapraidd start
    fi

To start it manually:

    sudo /etc/rc.d/rc.snapraidd start


Configuration
-------------

Before the daemon can operate correctly, you must configure it to match your
SnapRAID setup:

1. Copy the example configuration to the production path:

    sudo cp snapraidd.conf.example /etc/snapraidd.conf

2. Edit /etc/snapraidd.conf with your preferred text editor.

3. If the daemon is already running, apply changes by sending a SIGHUP signal:

    sudo systemctl reload snapraidd

For additional guidance, refer to the SnapRAID-Daemon manpage by typing:
`man snapraidd`


Uninstallation
--------------

To remove SnapRAID-Daemon from your system, run the following command from
the source directory:

    sudo make uninstall

On systemd units, it automatically stops the running service and disables it
from the boot sequence.

For safety and audit purposes, configuration files in '/etc/' and historical
log files in the 'log_directory' are NOT removed. These must be deleted
manually if a complete purge is desired.
